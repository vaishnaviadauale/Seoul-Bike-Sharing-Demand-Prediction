# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

# ğŸ“–Problem statement
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

1 Loading data and Diagnosing the data

2 Data Filtering

3 EDA of Row data to understand inside correlations

4 Feature Engineering

5 Feature Selection : we are not use much beacuase of limited features in our data(only one feature elemenate using hitmap to escalate multicoliniarity issue)

7 Model Training and Testing

# ğŸ“–Conclusion

xgbregressor and Randomforest models shows promising result, therefore it can be used to solve this problem.
